# Running

These rely on standard containers that are maintained separately in
[joshdevins/containers](http://github.com/joshdevins/containers). To run the
notebooks here, clone that repo, build the containers and start the notebook
server: `~/source/joshdevins/containers/data-science/bin/start-notebook.sh`
