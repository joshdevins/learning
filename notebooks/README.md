Notebooks for experiments, playing with methods, learning new things, etc.

# Running

These rely on standard containers that are maintained separately in
[joshdevins/containers](http://github.com/joshdevins/containers). To run the
notebooks here, clone that repo, build the containers and start the notebook
server from this directory with: `./bin/run`. The notebook server will run
relative to this directory.
